Playlist Intelligence Privacy Policy

1. Data Collection: Playlist Intelligence does not collect any personal data on external servers. All data, including YouTube playlist information and API credentials, is stored locally within the user's browser using chrome.storage.local and IndexedDB.

2. Data Usage: User data is used solely to provide the extension's core features: playlist reordering, search functionality, and collection analytics.

3. Third Parties: No data is sold or shared with third parties. The extension communicates directly with Google/YouTube APIs using the user's own credentials.

4. Data Retention: Data is stored until the user uninstalls the extension or manually clears their data through the extension's settings.
